# Rays

This code reads a polygon with n vertices (vx, vy) | (-1 <= vx <= 1) and (-1 <= vy <= 1) and generates 64 lines that may or not cross the polygon. The parts of the lines inside the polygon are colored green and the outside parts are colored gray.

To compile this code: g++ main.cpp -o <name of the object> -lGL -lglut -Wall
